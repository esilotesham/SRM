# Sign Language Recognition System 
### Summary of Project:
  - Creating a model that recognizes 3D images (3d images generated by Leap Motion) for Sign Language Recognition ( English alphabet )  using Leap motion and scikit learn (supervise learning, Classification algorithms  ) 


### Topics 
  1. Leap Motion 
  2. Machine Learning (Supervised machine Learning -> classification -> Multi-class classification -> Random Forest Algorithm ) 
  3. Python 2.7 
 Note: Leap Motion SDK for this Project Supports Only Python 2.7 . 
### How to setup the Demo: 
 - Download or Clone the Repository on your local computer. 
 - Using Pip (python's package installer) install all  necessary python modules for this project.
      - Leap -> (SDK Version 3.2.1 )
      - numpy 
      - sckit-learn
      - pandas
      - joblib
      - etc 
 - Connect the Leap Motion device and make sure that you have the drivers installed
 - Turn the Leap Motion tracking on. 
 - Using Python 2.7 env with all the dependencies installed : 
      - Run the file called "Codes/realtime_implementation.py"
      
  
   #### - Expected Result: 
    - Outputs: 
      1. File was Empty : meaning that the head information from the leap motion does not contain valid content. 
      2. Prediction: X
        where X can be : 
          - 0 :  for A of the sign language alphabet
          - 1 : for B of the sign language alphabet
          - 2 : for C of the sign language alphabet
